== Introduction ==
Purpose of this branch is to provide platform independent port of Skeldal using SDL library. 

== Roadmap ==
 - Rewrite functions that are using DirectX to SDL. (Video subsystem - needs testing, impossible without audio disabling, Audio - IN PROGRESS)
 - Rewrite pieces of engine written in assembly to C.
 - Get rid of MS Visual C++ dependency for build, using gcc/mingw with autotools for building
 - Provide port for POSIX compliant systems(GNU/Linux, *BSD, ..)
 - ARM port with opkg packages for openmoko

== License ==
The source code (*.cpp, *.h & *.c) is licensed under GPL version 3 or newer:
 * http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

== Instalation ==
Currently only win32 build using Visual Studio/Visual C++ express edition is supported
see INSTALL for further information about build process

== Autors ==
The Gates of Skeldal - The game was first released in 1998 by NapoleonGames (www.napoleongames.cz).
Sources of the original game Brany Skeldalu (meaning Gates of Skeldal in Czech) has been written by Ondrej Novak (bredysoft) and released under the terms of GNU General Public Licence 3 in 2008.
SDL port is currently being developed by Michael Hrabanek (ashen - JID:hrabanek@gmail.com)

== Organization of repository ==
stable - stable version, should be able to be built and at least new adventure starts without crash.
devel - bleeding egde development code, mostly just backup of my last night excess craziness, probably not even buildable, you definitely don't want to look at this
