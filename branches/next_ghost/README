The plan:
1) Port the engine to Linux
2) ???
3) Profit!

Now seriously, milestones for this branch:
1) Get the game at least partially working on x86 Linux (40% done)
2) Change the engine from task based to frame based (0% done)
3) Write a proper build system and fix ugly hacks in backend code (0% done)
4) Separate game code, libs, renderer, generic sound subsystem and backends
   (0% done)
5) Completely rewrite the remaining code to C++ (0% done)

Tasks for the next milestone:
1) Make it compile (100% done)
2) Play intro movie (50% done, the rest is sound, timing and keyboard input)
3) Main menu (75% done, no music or keyboard input)
4) Party generator (75% done, name input needs rewrite)
5) Saved game loader (75% done, game is loaded and runs but it still needs
   gameplay testing)
6) Developer credits (0% done)
7) Basic gameplay (25% done, game runs but you can't move yet and some color
   palettes are broken)
8) Combat (0% done)
9) Shopping (0% done)
10) Storytelling (0% done)

Savegame writer will be fixed later when the code doesn't use x86 specific
features and write tons of temp files. I'd have no motivation to make a proper
rewrite otherwise ;-)
