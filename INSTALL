== Building Skeldal from source ==
Currently only win32 build using Visual Studio/Visual C++ express edition is supported

== Getting source ==
You can get the latest stable source from sourceforge.net using svn:
svn co https://skeldal.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/skeldal/branches/ashen/sdl/stable/ 

== Getting data files ==
For the game to be able to run you need to get data files(graphic, audio files, etc...). They are available for non commercial use for free from Napoleon Games site - http://www.napoleongames.cz/download/brany_skeldalu_setup.exe

== Additional software needed ==
Download Visual C++ 2008 express edition from http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/#webInstall and Microsoft DirectX SDK from http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/aa937788.aspx (you can download it from GNU/Linux bypassing WGA test) and install it.
Open stable/Skeldal.vcproj in Visual C++ and add DirectX SDK/include directory(i.e. C:\Program Files\Microsoft DirectX SDK(August 2008)\Include) into additional include directories (Skeldal->Properties->C/C++->General->additional include directories)
Build Skeldal (Skeldal->Build)
You can now copy SkeldalD.exe from stable/Bin/ to install directory of skeldal(i.e. C:\Brany Skeldalu\)
Enjoy!
